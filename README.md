## Welcome to my Github page! My name is Ryan.
#### About Me
- 🎓 I'm currently a senior at **Princeton University**, where I'm studying Computer Science and pursuing a minor in Linguistics.
- ⭐️ Academically, I'm most excited about using computer science to create and analyze linguistic models and ultimately better understand how we comprehend language. 
- 🖥 I've recently found myself passionate about the field of **computer graphics**. I'm compelled not only by its many applications, but also by how it demands the intersection of computer science, math, art, physics, and more in an attempt to capture the world around us (or other worlds altogether).
#### My Pinned Repositories
- 🎵 **Acaprez Website**: This was a final project for the course **COS 333: Advanced Programming Techniques**. I worked as the full-stack developer on our team of four students, with the goal of providing a streamlined auditions/callbacks system that suited the needs of our university's acapella association.
- 🧠 **TRA 301 Final**: This was a final project for the course **TRA 301/COS 401: Introduction to Machine Translation**, in which my group applied Natural Language Processing techniques to create a script-based movie recommendation system.
- 🕹️ **christopherspeed.github.io**: This repository was for a final project for the course **COS 426: Computer Graphics**. Our group created a web-based first-person 3D driving simulator using the JavaScript libraries *three.js* and *cannon-es.js* as a basis for world rendering and player physics, and extending the techniques we learned in class to complete the game.
